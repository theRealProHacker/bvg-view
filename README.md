# BVG View

Track departures from multiple stations in Berlin\'s public transport network. Always know when your next train, tram, or bus is coming without using Google Maps. In comparison to the official BVG app, BVG View can display several stations at the same time.


Initially built using StackBiltz's Bolt ([bolt.new](https://bolt.new/)) and deployed on Netlify.
